Our lab needs to collect published paper of students. To make the information collection easier
to manage,
for those students who publish a new paper, it is **required** to submit the information by yourself following the instructions below.

## Instructions for students
### Accepted Email Received
* Visit [wiki publication](http://10.8.6.22/wiki/index.php/Publications) and create a new entry for your paper in the table.
* Upload your paper PDF to our wiki and add the link in the table.

Please finish it as soon as possible once your paper is accepted.

Your paper will soon be indexed by our lab website [publication page](http://10.8.4.170/lab2cnew/en/publication/).

### Paper Link is Available

TBD

## Instructions for Maintainer
Need revision.

If you have push access to [lab-bibtex](https://github.com/mace-cream/lab-bibtex) repository, you should
update `/data/public/bibtex` (which is also a git repo) directly using `git push`. The mechanism of synchronization of lab-bibtex to our lab website is through copying the generated markdown file to 
[website repo](https://github.com/mace-cream/mace-cream.github.io/tree/dev/content/publication).
